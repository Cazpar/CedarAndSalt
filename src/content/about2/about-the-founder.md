  Nootka Rose, Magnolia Blossoms and Lavender. The Cedar of Lebanon the “tree of
  her heart.” Being in the PNW, she enjoys the abundance of the Western Red
  Cedar trees as they are close. She also respects the natural beings and has
  always been keenly aware of the joy experienced with deep connection with the
  natural world and celebrates the abundance of growing research regarding the
  benefits nature has upon overall human health and well-being.

  acquired from years of learning the best practices in harmonious, sustainable
  landscaping and gardening. Her vision of Cedar & Salt is grounded in this
  passion and the guiding principles through which the company stands for.
