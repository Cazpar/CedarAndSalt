topper: About the founder
title: Kiara McLaughlin
text1: The heart of any true gardener, whether they work in obscurity at home,
  have a position in a successful company or a teaching post, has a vision that
  sees into a hopeful future when they plant a seed in the soil.
text2: Kiara was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest. She has been
  gardening since 2005, when she signed up for her first community garden space
  in Missoula, Montana. Since then, she has worked in landscaping in Missoula,
  Bellingham, Washington, Lopez and San Juan Islands.
text3: Kiara’s concern about native plants and invasive species began while she
  was literally working “on the ground” and noticing certain plants were
  outcompeting natives and watching them reproduce at alarming rates. She
  started to see how difficult some are to remove once established, like English
  ivy or Shasta daisy. She has been in conversation with the San Juan County
  Weed Control Board, San Juan County Public Works, the Washington State
  University Extension Office and local garden supply stores, seeking to
  increase awareness of what they are selling the unsuspecting home gardener.
text4: Her passion is sharing the knowledge she has acquired from years of
  learning the best practices in harmonious, sustainable landscaping and
  gardening. Her vision of Cedar & Salt is grounded in this passion and the
  guiding principles for which the company stands.
text5: "Kiara has always felt a deep connection to the evergreen genus Cedrus,
  or the “true” cedars, of which there are only three species in the world. The
  Cedar of Lebanon is the chosen artwork for the company, which was drawn by
  artist and creative collaborator Pamela Hoke. You can find her work here:"
