title: Our Partners
text1: We are a socially conscious organization. We believe in participating in
  the solution! Cedar and Salt supports recovery and reeducation for victims of
  human trafficking, environmental organizations of good repute, and the rights
  of domesticated and wild animals.
text2: We encourage awareness of best practices regarding control and disposal
  of invasive plant species, and how to respectfully and responsibly interact
  with the natural world. We are motivated to participate in restorative
  justice, and build bridges by reaching beyond the old, racially motivated
  paradigms that have limited our understanding of other perspectives, such as
  Indigenous People, who engaged in practices that successfully preserved the
  land for thousands of years.
