  - We have a responsibility to the planet and to future generations to practice
    restorative, ethical landscaping and planting.
  - Partnering with private citizens, government agencies and organizations to
    find solutions for our shared environment ensures that together we will have
    greater impact than if we operate in isolation.

    contribute to a more peaceful world.
