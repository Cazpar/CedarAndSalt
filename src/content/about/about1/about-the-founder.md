title: Our Vision for a Thriving Future
text1: "Here at Cedar & Salt, we believe that harmony can be achieved through
  respectful, compassionate listening, strategizing in a collaborative spirit,
  and co-creating beautiful landscapes and gardens that will thrive without
  unnecessary costs or stress. We remain grounded in the respecting the
  perpetual value of visually alluring landscapes and gardens from the joy and
  well-being benefits they provide, and the increased value of the property. We
  have done the research long enough to know that both these values can be
  achieved while working with the native landscape and our clients’ needs and
  desires. "
text2: We look forward to creating with you the ideal vision, strategizing a
  plan that addresses all needs, and implementing that plan with enthusiasm and
  in a spirit of meaningful purpose that makes for an exceptional journey and
  enjoyable experience as we “grow” your vision into reality.
text3: "In our commitment to helping create a more just, naturally thriving,
  regenerative and peaceful planet, Cedar & Salt is driven to help community by
  supporting organizations and missions that align with our core principle. We
  partner with organizations through sharing our knowledge and experiences,
  volunteering our time and resources towards specific projects that ensure that
  all have access to the benefits and knowledge of landscape and gardening, and
  educate about the importance of creating a more harmonious relationship with
  the natural world by working with it, not against it – working with each
  other, rather than against each other. We also believe in empowering the wise
  voices of Indigenous People and Women as part of this vision towards a more
  just, balanced, naturally regenerative and peaceful planet. "

listItems:
  - When we restore and create beautiful landscapes and urban plantings, we
    contribute to a more peaceful world.
  - Partnering with private citizens, government agencies and organizations to
    find solutions for our shared environment ensures that together we will have
    greater impact than if we operate in isolation.

    restorative, ethical landscaping and planting.

  approach assures Cedar & Salt clients longevity of a thriving landscape and
